# Facial Expression Recognition using CNN

This project implements a deep learning model to classify human facial expressions into distinct emotions such as Angry, Happy, Sad, and others using TensorFlow and Keras. It includes image preprocessing, model training, and a Streamlit-based web application for real-time prediction.

## 🔍 Project Features

* Facial emotion classification using deep learning
* Trained on a large dataset of labeled emotion images
* Live emotion prediction via uploaded image
* Deployed using a user-friendly Streamlit interface
* Modular and easy-to-extend codebase

## ✨ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abeselom-tesfay/Face-Emotion-Recognition.git
   cd Face-Emotion-Recognition
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Upload an image and see the predicted emotion.

## 📦 Dataset
